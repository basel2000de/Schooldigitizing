# School Digitizing Tool


The School Digitizing Tool is a Java-based command-line application designed to streamline the process of digitizing and organizing scanned documents for schools in Germany. The tool provides two main functionalities: splitting PDF files and organizing scanned documents.

Features:

1. Split PDF files: Users can split a PDF file into individual pages, with each page saved as a separate PDF file in the specified output folder.

2. Digitize papers: The tool facilitates the process of organizing scanned documents by allowing users to input the worker's name, document date, and document type. The application then moves the scanned documents into the appropriate folders according to a predefined folder structure.

The predefined folder structure includes:

Application Documents and Certificates (Bewerbungsunterlagen_Zertifikate)
Certificate of Good Conduct (Führungszeugnis)
Health Protection (Gesundheitsschutz)
House Rules (Hausordner)
Employee Appraisal (Mitarbeitergespräch)
Personal Data (persönliche Daten)
Contracts (Verträge)
Further Education (Weiterbildung)
Pension Documents (Rente_Unterlagen)

This program has been developed specifically to aid schools in Germany with their document organization needs. By automating the process of splitting and organizing PDF files, the School Digitizing Tool aims to save time and reduce manual labor for school administration staff.

To use the tool, simply follow the command-line prompts to provide the necessary input, and the program will handle the rest.
